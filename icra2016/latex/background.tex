\section{Background}

Human-aware navigation focuses on the interaction dynamics between humans and robots that occur as a result of navigation~\cite{Kruse2013}. In the literature, we can find several strategies for comfort ranging from appropriate approaching strategy~\cite{Dautenhahn2006}, maintaining appropriate distance~\cite{Takayama2009}, control strategies to avoid being noisy~\cite{Martinson2007} and use of planning for avoiding interference~\cite{Vasquez2012}. Additionally, several approaches to generate legibility for robot navigation, have been reported in \cite{lichtenthaler2013towards}.
