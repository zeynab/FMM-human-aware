\section{PROBABILISTIC DATA FUSION MODEL}

Multiple sensing sources (over head cameras, onboard kinect and lasers). MCMC based tracking model for integrating multiple sources. Joint state representation which reasons about multiple people in the environment.State of the art models of observation functions which reasons about the uncertainity of the different detectors (overhead camera detectors, kinect skeleton tracker, leg detector) which aids in accurate computation of uncertainity.
