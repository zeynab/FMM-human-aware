\section{EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS}
Real robot experiments which shows how a human aware navigation system works (which incorporates uncertainity in perception) and how it differs qualitatively with non-human aware navigation. Also try experiments which quantifies the difference when uncertainity is not part of the cost function for navigation.
