   abstract    = {This paper presents the concept and an example of
                 robject, a robotic entity embedded in an everyday object.
                 Robjects use the affordance of the original object to
                 ensure an efficient interaction and a high acceptance.
                 The example of the ranger robot shows that this approach
                 can be applied to the domestic environment. We explore
                 the integration of a robot (robject) into a family
                 household, by regarding the home as a ecosystem, which
                 consists of people, parts, products, activities, and
                 interactions. A test of the ranger robot in families
                 validates this holistic approach and shows the impact of
                 this type of design in respect to the complexity of the
                 robotic system.},

@Article{Magnenat2011,
   abstract    = {We propose ASEA, a modular architecture for event-based
                 control of complex robots. ASEBA runs scripts inside
                 virtual machines on self-contained sensor and actuator
                 nodes. This distributes processing with no loss of
                 versatility and provides several benefits. The closeness
                 to the hardware allows fast reactivity to environmental
                 stimuli. The exploitation of peripheral processing power
                 to filter raw data offloads any central computer and thus
                 allows the integration of a large number of peripherals.
                 Thanks to scriptable and plug-and-play modules, ASEBA
                 provides instant compilation and real-time monitoring and
                 debugging of the behavior of the robots. Our results show
                 that ASEBA improves the performance of the behavior with
                 respect to other architectures. For instance, doing
                 obstacle avoidance on the marXbot robot consumes two
                 orders of magnitude less bandwidth than using a
                 polling-based architecture. Moreover, latency is reduced
                 by a factor of two to three. Our results also show how
                 ASEBA enables advanced behavior in demanding environments
                 using a complex robot, such as the handbot robot climbing
                 a shelf to retrieve a book.},

abstract = "Abstract Navigation is a basic skill for autonomous robots. In the last years human–robot interaction has become an important research field that spans all of the robot capabilities including perception, reasoning, learning, manipulation and navigation. For navigation, the presence of humans requires novel approaches that take into account the constraints of human comfort as well as social rules. Besides these constraints, putting robots among humans opens new interaction possibilities for robots, also for navigation tasks, such as robot guides. This paper provides a survey of existing approaches to human-aware navigation and offers a general classification scheme for the presented methods. "
