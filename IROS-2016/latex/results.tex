\section{Experiments}
Need to explain the experimental set up here. Omnidirectional camera, monarch platform. And motivating the experiments below. 

\dv{Need to identify one or two scenarios where the uncertainity will help us. Like two people standing close by and the robot not going in between them. In the other case with deterministic tracker, the robot should go in between them.}

1. FMM + without uncertainity\\
2. FMM + with uncertainity\\
	2a. Convolution\\
	2b. clustering\\

3. DWA + without uncertainity\\
4. DWA + with uncertainity\\
	2a. Convolution\\
	2b. clustering\\

All these should have simulations and real robot experiments.\\
