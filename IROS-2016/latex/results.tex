\section{Experiments with Real Robots}

Single robot single person .

single robot single person (advanced perception) - make sure head faces the person at all times.

single robot multiple people no interaction

single robot multiple people active perception- can only focus on one person at a time. 

Perception inputs : 

1. Simulated uncertainity -  

Use greedy data fusion from skeleton tracker and leg detector.

How to provide some simulated uncertainity measure?


2. Real uncertainity -
