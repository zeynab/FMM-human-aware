\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we have proposed a novel approach for extending the model of social costmaps to include uncertainty of perception. Experiments show how this extended model can lead to more natural robot trajectories that preserve a social distance from people. By combining the output of a probabilistic MCMC-based tracker with an expectation costmap computation method based on convolution, we introduce a principled approach to solve the social path planning problem to explicitly deal with perception uncertainty in real environments with multiple people. 

The idea presented in this paper can be extended to other types of perception sources. By providing probabilistic perception outputs, the proposed model can fulfill this task without loss of performance. As future steps for this research, we plan to test with multiple perception sources with different uncertainty, particularly on-board perception which allows for much more flexibility in terms of applications and fewer physical limitations.
% We also plan to incorporate orientation information and uncertainty of orientation in our model. 
Tests with accurate ground truth data can help to understand the problem and its challenges better \dv{what problem and what challenges}. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty of perception \dv{what do you mean by quantifying the uncertanity} can be very useful in analyzing the behavior of expectation-based social costmap computation methods for further in-depth studies.  
\dv{The above sentence/para feels a bit vague. I would probably rephrase it}

\dv{Another interesting area of exploration is to look into other types of planners, namely local planners such as DWA, to compare the effect of human aware navigation using global and local planners.}
