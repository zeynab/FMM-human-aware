\subsection{Future work}


By taking the uncertainty of perception into account in a human-aware path planner, the same planning method could easily be reused even when the source of perception changes. As an example while overhead cameras can provide position information of people with good accuracy, when moving to on-board perception for a mobile robot, this accuracy and the associated uncertainty will largely change. This is even more significant, if tracking is done using an ultra-wide-band (UWB) tag. So, for more robustness and effectiveness, a human-aware navigation method, should be able to handle all these situations without undergoing major changes.
