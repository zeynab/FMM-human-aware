\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we have proposed a novel approach for extending the model of social costmaps to include the uncertainty of perception. Experiments show how this extended model can lead to more natural robot trajectories that preserve a social distance from people. By combining the output of a probabilistic MCMC-based tracker with an expectation costmap computation method based on convolution, we introduce a principled approach to solve the social path planning problem in real environments with multiple people. 

The idea presented in this paper can be extended to other types of perception sources. By providing probabilistic perception outputs, the proposed model can fulfil this task without loss of performance. As future steps for this research, we plan to test other types of perception, particularly on-board perception which allows much more flexibility in terms of applications and fewer physical limitations. We also plan to incorporate orientation information and uncertainty of orientation in our model. Additionally, more tests with more accurate ground truth data can help to understand the problem and its challenges better. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty of perception can be very useful in analyzing the behavior of expectation-based social costmap computation methods.
